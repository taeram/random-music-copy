random-music-copy
=================

Copy random mp3 files from source directory to destination. Good for filling your player/flash drive from a large music library.

### Features

By default, random-music-copy takes a random list of files from the source directory, and attempts to fill the destination.

Here are the options:
* Specify how many megabytes of files to copy
* Specify how many files to copy
* Put the files in numbered folders (defaults to 20 files per folder)
 * This is to get around an issue with stereos that support MP3's on a USB stick.
 * Some stereos will only "see" a certain number of files in a folder, and skip the rest.
